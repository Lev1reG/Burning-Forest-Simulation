# Burning Forest Simulation

Develop a fire simulation in which every cell in a 17 x 17 grid has a tree and only the middle cell's tree is on fire initially. Do not consider the posibility of lightning or tree growth. The simulaton should have a parameter for _burnProbability_, which is the probability that a tree adjacent to a burning tree catches fire. The function should return the percent of the forest burned. The program should run eight experiments with _burnProbability_ = 10%, 20%, 30%, ..., and 90% and should conduct each experiment 10 times. Also, have the code determine the average percent burned for each probability. Plot the data and fit a curve to the data.
